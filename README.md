## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is [Poon Athit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/athit-srimachand/), I'm a novice data analyst who is current studying MSc Business Analytics (2021/2022) in University of Bath School of Management. I transitioned into data/business analytics from Business Analyst background in the software development environment due to my passion in the beauty of how to achieve customers' insights from data. 

I have always believed that data-driven decision making is one of theÂ most significant components for ensuring business's prosperity. Meanwhile, analytics is more than a tool; it is critical to the success of every organisation and individual.

## Skills and Experience
* R (Data analysing and forecasting, familiar with tidyverse, data.table, forecast and foreach libraries)
* Tableau (Intermediate) 
* Excel (Capable of using Excel Solver/VBA) 
* SQL Server (Subqueries, conditional statements, data manipulation and data aggregation)
* Jira (Full Software development lifecycle management)
